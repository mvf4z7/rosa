wifi adapter install:

-plug in wall power and ethernet before USB dongle

lsusb #should see the adapter as one of the devices
apt-get update
apt-cache realtek
apt-get install firmware-realtek # may say it's already been installed, that's fine
ifconfig -a # should now see a wlan0 connection
nano /etc/network/interfaces

-add the following under the #wifi example section
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp

-and then go back to the terminal and...
ifup wlan0

-should see: Internet Systems Consortium DHCP Client 4.2.2...
Press ^c

-Search for wireless access points:
iwlist wlan0 scan
wpa_passphrase chosenSSID thepassword > /etc/wpa.conf
nano /etc/wpa.conf

-add things to make network{ look like this:
network = {
	ssid="chosenSSID"
	#psk="thepassword"
	key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
	pairwise=CCMP TKIP
	group=CCMP TKIP
	psk=ksjdf;laksfhiouwehtrk;jh;aslfk;jas;lfjas;odf
}

-Back in /etc/network/interfaces add:
wpa-conf /etc/wpa.conf under the iface wlan0 inet dhcp you added earlier

-Back to terminal
/etc/init.d/networking restart
ifconfig -a
ifup wlan0
ifconfig -a # should now see that the wlan0 device has an ip address

-Back to /etc/network/interfaces
add "auto wlan0" where you have been entering the other things, this will allow it to run on boot
